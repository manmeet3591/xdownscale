# Summary

`xdownscale` is an open-source Python package for spatiotemporal resolution enhancement (super-resolution) of gridded Earth observation datasets using deep learning. It provides a consistent and modular interface for applying and experimenting with a variety of deep learning models (e.g., UNet, SRCNN, FSRCNN) for downscaling geospatial data.

Built on top of `xarray`, `xdownscale` is designed for Earth science and remote sensing applications, enabling easy training, prediction, and GPU-accelerated workflows. The package simplifies patch-based inference and incorporates experiment tracking via Weights & Biases. It supports a variety of datasets such as DMSP-OLS and VIIRS nighttime lights, and land surface temperature (LST), helping users recover finer-resolution data from coarse measurements.

# Statement of Need

Remote sensing products are often spatially coarse due to sensor limitations or legacy archive resolutions. Deep learning-based super-resolution offers a promising avenue for increasing the utility of such datasets, but existing tools are often not tailored for geospatial data formats or workflows.

`xdownscale` fills this gap by:

- Supporting `xarray` data structures used in Earth science
- Providing access to state-of-the-art super-resolution architectures
- Enabling scalable, patch-based training and inference
- Supporting GPU acceleration and experiment tracking
- Reducing engineering overhead for geospatial deep learning experiments

It is intended for researchers and practitioners in climate science, remote sensing, and related disciplines.
